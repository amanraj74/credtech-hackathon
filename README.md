## üöÄ Project Description

[cite_start]This platform addresses the shortcomings of traditional credit ratings, which are often slow, opaque, and lagging behind real-world events[cite: 8, 9, 10]. By ingesting data from multiple real-time sources, our system generates a dynamic credit score and, most importantly, provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of how that score was calculated.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Connects to live APIs for up-to-the-minute financial and news data.
-   [cite_start]**Explainable AI (XAI):** Uses a transparent, rule-based model to generate scores, ensuring users can understand the "why" behind the number[cite: 15].
-   [cite_start]**Unstructured Data Analysis:** Incorporates news sentiment analysis to capture market perception and recent events[cite: 56].
-   [cite_start]**Interactive Dashboard:** A clean, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy analysis[cite: 22].

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture & Tech Stack

The application follows a simple, robust architecture:

1.  **Frontend:** A web dashboard built with **Streamlit**.
2.  **Backend Logic:** Written in **Python**.
3.  **Data Sources:**
    -   [cite_start]**Structured Data:** Financial ratios from **Alpha Vantage**[cite: 28].
    -   [cite_start]**Unstructured Data:** News headlines from **NewsAPI.org** for sentiment analysis[cite: 29].
4.  [cite_start]**Deployment:** The application is containerized and hosted live on **Streamlit Community Cloud**[cite: 52].

## ‚öñÔ∏è Design Trade-offs

A key architectural decision was the choice of the scoring model.

-   **Chosen Approach:** A rule-based, interpretable model.
-   **Alternative:** A complex "black-box" model (e.g., a neural network).
-   [cite_start]**Reasoning:** The hackathon's core challenge is **explainability**[cite: 15]. [cite_start]A simpler, rule-based model provides perfect transparency and feature-level explanations, directly fulfilling the problem statement[cite: 20]. This was prioritized over a potentially marginal increase in predictive accuracy from a more complex model whose decisions would be harder to understand and trust.
